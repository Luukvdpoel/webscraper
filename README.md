Once Upon a Pitch
Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Background and Motivation
Today, storytelling has become one of the most important weapons in every founder's arsenal it is used to  help them articulate their vision, build credibility, and attract investment (Martens et al., 2007). The important thing here is that especially in early-stage and high-uncertainty environments like the world of tech startups investors are looking at so much more than the product or the business model. they are examining you as a founder and what you could become (Parhankangas & Ehrlich, 2014). Here, stories serve as both a tool of persuasion and a means of crossing the gulfs of information that come with these startups looking for investment. They provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to ground abstract concepts in emotional, relatable reality (Manning & Bejarano, 2016).
With the rise of platforms like Kickstarter, AngelList and europe.republic, storytelling became even more critical and visible (Anglin et al., 2022). On them, startups fight for the attention of potential backers and the potency of a founder’s story can literally make the difference between full funding and obscurity. Especially in technology fields, where the product or service is complex or novel. this is relevant beceause as a founder you need to translate the offering into an understandable and engaging story.
There are plenty of real-world startup examples to illustrate this. A smartwatch startup, Pebble, famously raised more than $10 million on Kickstarter by framing a story of time and connectivity in a new way. Their pitch was more than just the product, it was about the problem that it was solving, the people behind it and a vision of the future. These success stories have prompted many to assert that narrative might be as crucial as product-market fit when it comes to early stage funding situations (Martens et al., 2007).
Yet despite increasing anecdotal and qualitative recognition of its effectiveness, storytelling is still under-explored quantitatively (Manning & Bejarano, 2016), and especially in terms of the causative effect of specific storytelling components on metrics like a project’s success in receiving investment. Furthermore, the influence of context such as pitch modality, the maturity of the startup or the sector has not been investigated systematically.
1.2 Research Problem and Relevance
Though there is existing research (Martens et al., 2007; Roundy, 2014; Anglin et al., 2022) showing that narrative quality corresponds to investor engagement and funding, few studies parse storytelling into measurable pieces (Clarke et al., 2019). And there’s not much clarity on which elements of storytelling such as emotional tone, narrative coherence, use (or omission) of metaphor, founder-centricity are the most predictive of startup success. Separation of use of storytelling as descriptive versus a binary variable is most common in studies.
Just as significant is the absence of a contextual approach (Kaminski & Hopp, 2019). Do they work equally for all sorts of startups, in all situations when it comes to pitching? For example, early-stage startups might need to lean more heavily on a narrative because they don’t have data, whereas late-stage companies have both metrics and projections. In parallel, video pitches may enable emotion and non-verbal elements to play a bigger role than in text pitches where structure, clarity, and single-faceted expression are essential.
These “gap” areas hinder the utility of current research for practitioners and academics. Entrepreneurs don’t just need to understand that storytelling is important they need to understand what type of story to tell, and how. This thesis addresses that need.
1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Research
With this in mind, this study attempts to explore the effects on the startup journey itself, through storytelling in the tech industry.
• What narrative elements are most contributing to successful startup funding.
• Exploring contextual moderators such as pitch type (e.g., medium), sector, company stage, etc. that may buffer storytelling effects.
• Building a quantitative framework for assessing storytelling quality through the use of natural language processing (NLP), as well as manual coding.
1.4 Main Research Question
To what extent do narrative-based storytelling techniques in entrepreneurial pitches shape startup success, and to what degree are these relationships moderated by contextual factors like industry sector, pitch medium, and company stage?
1.5 Hypotheses
• H1: There is a positive relationship between high-quality storytelling techniques in entrepreneurial pitches and startup success.
• H2: The effect of storytelling quality on startup success is stronger for early stage startups than for late stage startups.
• H3: Narrative storytelling is more predictive of success in video-based than text-based pitches.
• H4: Perceived trust is greater via founder-centric narratives as compared to product-centric narratives.
• H5: Pitches incorporating elements of emotional storytelling will generate higher consumer engagement than pitches predominantly centered around data-led content.

1.6 Research Design and Method (Short Overview)
This study takes a quantitative research design approach, based on observational pitch-data scraped from crowdfunding and investment platforms (such as Kickstarter and AngelList). This will result in a dataset containing about 500–700 pitches. The narrative content will be assessed for emotional tone, metaphor usage, coherence, and founder-centricity via natural language processing (NLP) tools (e.g. VADER for sentiment analysis) and manual coding frameworks.
Dependent variables include:
•	percentage raised of funding goal
•	Reveneu/ profits
•	Number of investors/backers
This study does not prioritize a single success metric; instead, it treats funding percentage, number of backers, and revenue as complementary indicators to provide a multidimensional view of startup performance.
Moderating variables include:
• Pitch format (video, text, hybrid)
• Stage of startup (early vs late stage)
• Industry vertical (fintech, healthtech, greentech, etc.)
Besides, moderation effects and hypothesis tests through regression models with interaction terms are used for validation purposes. The findings will help to shed light on when storytelling works best.
1.7 Significance of the Study
This thesis provides a unique contribution in providing an operationalised and quantitative look at narrative elements, which have historically been treated qualitatively. The practical implications are also quite significant: founders, incubators, accelerators, and pitch coaches can apply this knowledge to adapt pitches better to target audiences. Investors might also find themselves with more organized tools at their disposal for gauging pitches’ emotional and rhetorical appeal, along with the usual business metrics.
While theoretically, this work draws from and synthesizes Narrative Theory (Maclean, M., Harvey, C., & Chia, R., 2012), Signaling Theory (Connelly et al., 2011), Impression Management (Parhankangas & Ehrlich 2014), and Cultural Entrepreneurship (Lounsbury, M., & Glynn, M. A., 2001) to create a comprehensive model of storytelling in entrepreneurial contexts, it also makes a number of practical contributions. The study aims to provide both qualitative insights and quantitative analyses to not only build a bridge between persuasive entrepreneurial communication and existing theoretical knowledge, but also encourage further academic research on the primary mechanisms and boundary conditions of entrepreneurial persuasion.
1.8 Structure of the Thesis
The rest of the thesis proceeds as follows:
• In Chapter 2, the literature review is presented; likewise, the theoretical frame of the analysis is established.
• Chapter 3 presents the research methodology, outlining the data sources, coding schemes, and statistical techniques employed.
• Chapter 4 presents and interprets the analysis results.
• Chapter 5 presents the results in relation to the research questions, and presents practical and theoretical implications as well as directions for future research.
So overall this study aims to shed light on how storytelling works in startup funding pitches and more meaningfully, why and when it works the best. In an environment where thousands of startups compete for limited investment resources, the ability to tell a resonant, credible, and emotional story may be the most potent asset a founder has.
Chapter 2: Literature Review
The concept of storytelling is an amalgamation of perspectives in the literature arguing different forms of narratives are used by entrepreneurs. Relevant research is reviewed in this chapter in order to create a basis for the study. Section 2.1 relates to the role of storytelling in economic and business settings and offers the argument that narratives will be used from the perspective of the new ventures to gain legitimacy and acquire resources. In Section 2.2, we can identify some key narrative elements (including emotional appeal, coherence, and founder-centricity) that define an effective startup story. In Section 2.3, we consider contextual moderators, such as medium of the pitch or the stage and industry sector of the startup, that might affect the strength of the relationship between storytelling and venture outcomes. This study is grounded in several theoretical frameworks, which are laid out in Section 2.4, including narrative theory, signaling theory, impression management, cultural entrepreneurship and models of persuasion, which collectively clarify the mechanisms through which storytelling can lead to startup success. Finally, Section 2.5 provides a survey of gaps in the existing literature that our research attempts to fill.
2.1 Storytelling in the World of Entrepreneurship
In the communication landscape of startups, storytelling is a core strategy for capturing the attention of stakeholders operating under uncertainty like new start-ups. Martens et al. (2007) and Manning & Bejarano (2016) suggest that entrepreneurial narratives are sensemaking devices that enable founders to anchor their entrepreneurial effort in a broader industry or societal trend and therefore overcome legitimacy challenges confronted when appealing to investors. Lounsbury and Glynn (2001) and Maclean et al. (2012) understand storytelling as a mechanism of cultural entrepreneurship where founders construct narratives that associate the new enterprise with dominant cultural values and norms. By building a startup’s story into familiar themes (like innovation, disruption, or social good) (Huangfu, 2023), entrepreneurs can make their business seem easier to understand and more legitimate to potential backers. Thus, these narratives function both as persuasive devices and as lenses through which the entrepreneurial journey is viewed, something that is the crucial basis for obtaining resources and achieving early legitimacy.
The storytelling process in entrepreneurship conveys the “what” and “how” behind a business idea, as well as the “why” behind a venture’s purpose and vision, which has growing relevance for the alignment of stakeholders. Garud et al. (2014) highlight that good stories provide entrepreneurs with the tools to create a visionary future, lowering a potential perceived risk as there are no tangible results or proofs of concept to rely on in such instances. That is the part of what makes storytelling particularly powerful in tech industries, where innovation cycles come at breakneck speed and startups frequently request that investors purchase a promise of the future instead of a proven track record. This prescribed cause-and-effect narrative structure in effective entrepreneurial pitches (e.g. Contenting a customer problem, presenting a potential solution, envisioning the outcomes) makes the narratives more plausible and clear to investors (Werven et al., 2019; Pellegrini & Hunter, 2024). By demonstrating an obvious connection between the startup’s product or idea and a genuine, projected future need in the world, founders can lower uncertainty and allow audiences to visualize the potential of the venture. So in short, storytelling is not simply dressing up entrepreneurship; it is a key fundamental by which you convert radical notions into interest worthy of supporting and pursuing (Clarke et al., 2019; Manning & Bejarano, 2016).
2.2 Key Narrative Elements
A successful startup pitch typically depends on the clever use of some key narrative elements. A number of key components of entrepreneurial stories have been identified in the literature, which can have a substantial impact on investor perceptions and decisions. Here these elements and their relevance are summarized as suggested by previous research:
• Emotional Appeal (Tone): The emotional impact of a narrative creates more audience engagement and trust. Pitches that communicate true passion and emotion can create a deeper connection with investors. For example, Shane et al. (2020) reveal that when a founder displays passion during storytelling, it has a significant effect on listeners’ neural engagement and on enhancing the founder’s perceived credibility. Emotional cues, whether in enthusiastic wording or anecdotes, can keep investors engaged with a founder’s mission (Petty & Cacioppo,1986; Manning & Bejarano, 2016). The effect is even more pronounced in video pitches (Pera & Viglia, 2016), where tone of voice, facial expressions and other non-verbal cues add to the persuasion impact. In that regard, emotional storytelling must be complemented with substance if it is to resonate: Vázquez and Álvarez-Delgado (2019) and Clarke et al. (2019) found that pitches are more persuasive when logical argument is combined with appeals to emotion than when they are merely fact-based.
• Founder personal stories: Stories that highlight the founder’s personal path, principles and hardship usually generate more audience interest and trust (Roundy, 2014; Gruss & Collier, 2023; Pollack et al., 2012). Entrepreneurs make the business concept more relatable by telling personal stories or the reason of starting the venture. Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between founder-driven stories and favorable pitch outcomes. Founder stories emphasising personal struggles and vision have been shown to enhance investor confidence. Another recent study found that, in addition to general storytelling, stories that highlight the founder correlated positively with funding success, especially in early-stage and crowdfunding environments that can hinge on a human connection to the founder.
• Use of Metaphor and Vivid Language: Metaphor and vivid language helps bridge the gap between complex or technical ideas and everyday language. Startups often focus on new technologies or business models that outsiders may not find easy to understand. Founders can make the unknown known using analogies or storytelling devices. Clarke et al. (2019) show how figurative language in entrepreneurial pitches (along with congruent gestures) can increase investors’ comprehension and make the pitch more memorable. The right metaphor conveys a startup’s value proposition, making an image stick with potential investors.
• Narrative: Every coherent narrative consists of a clear beginning, middle, and end and proceeds logically so that stakeholders can easily follow along (Van Werven et al., 2019). High narrative coherence means that the pitch is not simply a collection of points but rather a story that develops for a reason. A more coherent structure increases credibility and audience recall as investors can follow the step-to-step path of why one part of the story leads to the other. Van Werven et al. (2019) observe that coherent storytelling enhances narrative plausibility to the degree where the deal narrative “makes sense” and is plausible which facilitates improved decision-making by potential investors. The power of a clear pitch is that it offers a clear layout of the problem solution, business model, and a little view of where you are headed. This helps the tractability of the cause-and-effect relationships (i.e., solving specific problem leads to market opportunity, resulting in returns), making the investment case more robust.
• Authenticity: Trust is significantly driven by perceived authenticity in storytelling (Manning & Bejarano, 2016). Authenticity means the story feels real, credible and true to the entrepreneur’s own character and values. Like any audience, investors can often tell when a story is overpolished or exaggerated. Stories that feel authentic and sincere are more convincing. As mentioned by Parhankangas and Ehrlich (2014), entrepreneurs who adopt impression management tactics in accordance with authenticity (as opposed to simply being manipulative) tend to be more appealing to business angels. An authentic narrative often features owning up to challenges or failures and demonstrate how a founder learned from them, which can enhance credibility. The bottom line is that if the entrepreneur is honest and consistent in his or her story and presentation, he or she is more likely to convince an investor that person is trustworthy, and the business is worthy of investment (Nembhard et al., 2022).
And they’re often used together in successful narratives: Emotional appeal, founder focus, descriptive language, structure, and authenticity (Key & Duening, 2020; Anglin et al., 2022). While each component having its own way of contributing to a story’s appeal, it’s this combined effect that ultimately shapes how the pitch is received. For example, a pitch built on emotion and personality but with no coherent structure might come off as manic, or might be viewed as unconvincing, while the opposite, a pitch that’s flawlessly structured but lacks an emotional tie, might not convince. Therefore, entrepreneurs have to juggle between these components to create a persuasive story for their venture.
2.3 Contextual Moderators
Now, though storytelling isn't always relevant when dozens of factors determine startup outcome. They recommend a moderation approach to narrative effectiveness related to some contextual factors. That is to say: the same story can have different outcomes based on how, when and to whom it is told. Important contextual moderators emerging from existing entrepreneurship storytelling literature are as follows:
• Medium of the Pitch: The format or medium of a pitch can increase or decrease the power of storytelling (Kaminski & Hopp, 2019). Pitches delivered via video (e.g., in crowdfunding campaign videos or in-person presentations) enable founders to utilize tone of voice, facial expressions and visual aids, opening yet more channels of emotional and non-verbal communication. Such cues could help amplify the story’s punch. Pera and Viglia (2016) determined that video-based entrepreneurial storytelling enhanced audience emotional connection and relationship with the venture relative to stories presented in text-only format. In contrast, text-based pitches (like written summaries on investment platforms or business plan documents) require great skills in writing (Manning & Bejarano, 2016; Key & Duening, 2020); clarity and text cohesion become even more vital if the narrative is limited to written form only ( e.g., Kaminski & Hopp, 2019). The format in which a story is told influences which kinds of powerful storytelling are recognized or succeed: a video pitch can play to dynamic delivery and visuals while a written pitch must lean on linguistic precision and clarity to convey the story.
• Startup Stage: The stage of the startup (early-stage vs. later-stage) can dictate the impact of storytelling on investors. Early-stage startups have little performance data or proven traction to rely on, so they are heavily dependent on narrative as a signal of potential and a mechanism to mitigate uncertainty (Pollack et al.; 2012). And often, a good story is one of the main drivers for investor interest in such cases. Lu et al. (2022) find that founder passion and narrative intensity matter more in early rounds of funding, where trust and perceived potential trump hard metrics. At later stages, investors have more tangible data (revenues, number of clients, etc.) and may put relatively more weight on those metrics, but storytelling still matters for communicating vision and maintaining excitement. Hypothesis (H2) captures the expectation that narrative quality is particularly important for younger ventures. For an early-stage company with little to offer beyond a vision and a prototype, it might just be effective storytelling that assures investors to take a chance.
• Industry Sector: The industry or sector to which a startup belongs can play a moderating role with respect to the effectiveness of storytelling. In tech-based industries (software, biotech, etc.), products and value propositions tend to be complex or formless. At this point, storytelling becomes a critical tool in reorienting the technology around human needs and concrete benefits (Anglin et al., 2022). O’Connor (2002; 2004) talks about how narratives serve as a tool for high-tech startups to be perceived as legitimate and relevant within an uncertain, contested, and potentially skeptical market for a never-before-seen high-tech innovation. By converting technical gibberish to relatable endangered species (e.g., sharing how an AI algorithm saves a small business owner time), founders bring the innovation within reach, as well as the immediate sense of the impact. Conversely, in more traditional or straightforward industries, investors may focus on straightforward business metrics over story, although a coherent narrative still has the potential to differentiate a venture from its competitors. In general, it is very important to align the story with the expectations and norms of the industry; what works in a social enterprise context (focusing on mission and impact) may not work in a fintech context (particularly focusing on security and scalability, in addition to the story of why) (Chapple et al., 2021).
• Funding Context (Platform/Audience): The funders are also likely to impact the reception of a story. Take crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter: Most backers are ordinary folks or enthusiasts who take a strong interest in emotional storytelling and personal passion; a moving founder video can drive community support (Manning & Bejarano, 2016; Anglin et al., 2022). By contrast, angel investors or VCs practice more thorough due diligence and look more skeptically at grand narratives (Pollack et al., 2012). What gets a crowdfunding audience excited in a pitch narrative can be seen quite differently by a focused VC, who wants real business models and tangible stuff to make the story credible. Consequently, entrepreneurs may need to adapt their storytelling techniques depending on their audience: with consumer-facing crowdfunding, engaging with emotion and vision, while with professional investors balancing those with data and realism. The same story might land differently due to the listeners’ experience, objectives and risk appetite.
• Investor Characteristics: Individual differences in the investor themselves (beyond the general audience type above) may moderate narrative impact, though this area is less explored. Some investors are naturally more susceptible to stories by character, cognitive style or experience (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). While others are more analytical. It is argued that an investor’s risk preference or approach to information processing could impact the way they decode and assess an entrepreneur’s account. For example, a narrative that resonates with someone effective at intuitive decision-making might be given high sensitivity and weight, while a narrative that sounds the same to an analytical investor without data to back up the story may cause skepticism (Clarke et al., 2019). These differential effects are difficult to predict or measure in aggregate, but we should at least take note of them. It also reminds us that “one size fits all” storytelling probably doesn’t exist; effective communication can depend on understanding the specific values and makeup of whoever the target investor, or audience, is.
This illustrates why context is so important for entrepreneurial storytelling (Anglin et al., 2022; Key & Duening, 2020). A strong narrative is an asset, but its potency is determined in part by how that story is told, who’s telling it to whom and under what conditions. This literature review highlights that, as an entrepreneur, be cognisant of the medium (video vs text), tailor the story according to the maturity stage of the startup, align the narrative with industry expectations, and consider the context and audience in the funding ask. These concerns, and others, inform the present study’s approach, which takes a different approach to examining storytelling’s effect on success and these key moderators.
2.4 Theoretical Framework
The storytelling elements that may contribute to startup success is arguably best understood from multiple theoretical perspectives. The following mentoring frameworks illustrate the ways in which narratives can shape investor decision-making and venture outcomes:
• Narrative Theory: Narrative theory states that human beings make sense of the world through stories (Manning & Bejarano, 2016; Martens et al., 2007). In the startup world, that means a startup’s narrative can influence how potential investors and customers perceive its value and opportunity. Like storytellers, founders take the events (of challenges overcome and milestones already achieved and a vision for the future) and reframe them in a way that potentially disparate audiences can follow and believe. Manning and Bejarano (2016) contribute to this knowledge by suggesting that such narratives in pitches shape what audiences come to understand collectively about a new venture and its value, as it takes an abstract idea and turns it into a narrative arc that people are able to follow and relate to. Using narrative devices (plot, character, conflict, resolution), entrepreneurs can shape what others think (and feel) when they first encounter their opportunity, which will determine interest and buy-in.
• Signaling theory: When the stakes are high and uncertainty is high, such as in the case of startup fundraising, information asymmetry is a major problem: Entrepreneurs have more information about their venture than potential investors. The (Connelly et al., 2011) theory of signalling illustrates how the entrepreneur can move information to investors through signals. Stories told within the pitches may provide this signal. A compelling, passionate story communicates signs of founder competence, commitment, and vision that hard data cannot. For instance, a coherent and visionary story suggests the founder has a plan, as well as confidence in the venture’s direction. Emotion, for example, can be a proxy for founder passion and commitment; polished narrative structure, for the founder’s preparation and professionalism (Lu et al., 2022). Effective storytelling reduces uncertainty and asymmetry, which means it gives investors a sense that they understand the venture, as well as the founder; having the same resources as you can only make them confident that their investment is in good hands.
• Impression Management Theory: Entrepreneurs tell stories not only about their startups, but implicitly (or explicitly) also about themselves. Impression management theory (in the field of organizational behavior and social psychology) studies individuals’ attempts to control the impressions others form about them (Leary & Kowalski, 1990). In the business world, particularly with entrepreneurial pitches, storytelling is a form of impression management. Founders strategically frame their narratives to emphasize their strengths and minimize weaknesses, as well as identify their characteristics with those that appeal to investors (Parhankangas & Ehrlich, 2014). So, for example, a founder could tell the story of overcoming difficulties based on a personal experience to show resilience and leadership skills. Entrepreneurs control the narrative around them, controlling how investors will see their credibility and character. That matters because early-stage investors often put as much on the line for the people as for the idea. A story that illustrates the founder’s passion, expertise and dedication is likely to stick and tip an investment decision in your favor.
• Cultural Entrepreneurship Theory: Cultural entrepreneurship helps define how the practice of entrepreneurship relates to cultural and storytelling contexts (Maclean et al., 2012). According to Lounsbury and Glynn (2001), successful entrepreneurs are “cultural operatives,” with stories designed to align their newly launched ventures with relevant and legitimate themes in broader cultural narratives. In practical terms, that means framing the story about the startup inside principles or values that have resonance in society or in the market. For instance, a startup may lean into the concept of social impact in what’s known as the framing of the gain and position the narrative that it is not just selling a product, but is part of the plan to create a better world. In doing so, it draws on cultural values that could lend legitimacy and meaning to the enterprise. Storytelling is the act of linking the new venture to well-known narrative narratives (the garage startup mythos, the founder’s hero’s journey, or the riding of a wave of the moment like sustainability or empowerment). Also, it can help with affinity as it's easier for stakeholders to support the venture because it's really just part of a story that they're already familiar with. Cultural entrepreneurship theory thus shows how some stories (e.g., “disrupting an industry” or “founder as visionary underdog”) emerge and re-emerge in successful venture narratives as they are culturally productive templates that grant legitimacy.
• Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM): The Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) describes the two main ways that people respond to persuasive messages: through the central route and the peripheral route. The central route and peripheral route are two ways that people process information, with the central route allowing for careful, logical consideration of the arguments (high elaboration), and peripheral route providing a more emotional or heuristic processing of information (low elaboration). Either route can be at play in an entrepreneurial pitch. Cold hard rational business information (market size, financial projections) is targeting the central route and storytelling elements (emotional anecdotes, vision casting, vivid demonstrations) often target the peripheral route (Key & Duening,2020; Clarke et al., 2019). ELM posits that when audiences (investors) do not have enough time, knowledge or interest to process through all the details (often the case in the pitch setting), they tend to focus on the peripheral cues, i.e. the feelings and general impressions elicited by the entrepreneur’s tale and delivery. Emotional narratives have thus particular persuasive power in such environments, as it helps the audience feel good about a venture even though they haven’t probed every data point (Manning & Bejarano, 2016). 
in fact, for sustained persuasion, the “story” should not go against factual evidence; the best pitch involves both routes by supplying sound data and surrounding it with a strong narrative. Through the lens of ELM, storytelling provides a persuasive component that works alongside the data on an emotional and bias-driven level that augments, but does not supplant, the logical argument.
All of these theories combined provide a strong presence of knowledge around entrepreneurial storytelling. Stories, they explain, are not mere anecdotes; they act as signals in information-starved settings, as tools for managing impressions and legitimacy, and as tools for both emotional and logical persuasion (Anglin et al.,2022; Manning & Bejarano, 2016). This theoretical foundation serves to back the constructs explored throughout this thesis and also to help the interpretation of findings. If a storytelling element is shown to be a determinant of funding success, we can leverage the theories to rationalize whether this is because of diminished information asymmetry (signaling); increased faith in the founder (impression management); cultural alignment (cultural entrepreneurship); increased activation (narrative theory); or peripheral-route persuasion (ELM), or some combination theory.
2.5 Gaps in the Literature
While growing scholarly interest has developed around the phenomenon of entrepreneurial storytelling, at least three major gaps remain in the literature:
• No real quantitative metrics; most prior startup storytelling research has been qualitative/conceptual. Even as case studies and narrative analyses have contributed to our knowledge, there are few quantitative gauges of specific aspects of storytelling and their effects (Manning & Bejarano, 2016; Martens et al., 2007)). Narrative features (e.,g, metaphor frequency, emotional language level, story coherence), however, have only rarely been operationalized, so that their effects can be statistically examined (Anglin et al., 2022). The end result is that we know storytelling matters, but we have very little empirical evidence specifying which storytelling elements matter most (and how much). A more quantitative approach can add some precision to this subject by taking, say, sentiment analysis where researchers measure emotional tone or presence of personal stories in speeches, then looking up how those correlated with success. This deficit begs for studies that hold storytelling variables to the same rigor as, say, financial or operational variables.
• Underexplored Moderation Effects: Context seems to have huge impacts on storytelling effectiveness and yet few studies actually test these moderating factors explicitly (Kaminski et al., 2019). For example, although a good story is sometimes stated to be especially important for an early-stage startup or that video pitches can work well, research has rarely compared these conditions in a systematic and quantitative manner. Large-sample studies that cross narrative quality with context variables (pitch medium, company stage, industry type) to examine how outcomes vary are needed (Anglin et al., 2022). In the absence of such research, recommendations are generic, and they may not be right for everyone. This work seeks to take a step towards this by testing interaction effects (e.g., as H2 suggests, does H1 hold more strongly for early stage companies? Does the medium heavily influence the result (as H3 implies).
• Lack of Cross-Context Analyses: The majority of literature is centered to one context or platform at a time. Some, for instance, examine storytelling in crowdfunding campaigns (like Kickstarter) outside the context of communicating something to a venture capital audience, or vice versa. Comparisons across different fundraising contexts are few (Chapple et al., 2021; Kaminski et al., 2019). This is an absence since different components may look different in each setup, and entrepreneurs today utilize multiple funding channels (crowdfunding, angel investment, accelerators, etc.). A broader cross-platform analysis can establish whether specific narrative strategies work equally across platforms or are more tailored to specific platforms. Also, cross-country or cross-cultural comparisons are few; cultural context may shape how stories are told and received, but most studies have focused on Western settings. The current study attempts to expand the horizon and verify the consistency of storytelling effects by pooling data from multiple sources (possibly multiple platforms or geographical areas).
• Investor Cognitions/Perceptions Being Overlooked: The data counted in funding decisions are generally of interest (did the startup get funded, how much, etc.), but intermediate investor responses to the storytelling process are less studied. There are theories that storytelling builds trust, increases engagement or boosts recall of the pitch, but those aren’t always tracked (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Parhankangas & Ehrlich, 2014; Clarke et al., 2019). They matter for they are the mechanics of how storytelling probably functions. For instance, a founder story of personal passion might enact something like this: it increases the investor’s trust in the founder, which in turn increases the likelihood of investment. If research only collects whether or not an investment was made, these more subtle effects may go unnoticed. Most potential research claims that would survey or experiment on investor audiences to capture at that moment their level of trust, emotional engagement, or memory of different pitches is another vacuum. Such research would complement studies focused on outcomes and help create a fuller picture of narrative impact. Without it the current literature may underestimate the reasons for a narrative success or failure.
In short, the literature shows that storytelling is a potent component of entrepreneurial communication, but it raises questions about measurement, context, breadth, and conditions process. This thesis aims to address some of these gaps. Specifically, it will operationalize narrative elements and empirically assess their effects on success (closing the first gap) by employing a large dataset of startup pitches and a quantitative approach. It will explicitly incorporate moderating factors such as pitch medium and startup stage in the analysis (closing the second gap). This leverages data across various pitch settings (this addresses the third gap), and does not directly measure investor cognition but the discussion of results infers what possible cognitive mechanisms exist and paves the wave for future work to unpack (addressing the fourth gap indirectly). By doing so, the research hopes to offer theoretical insights but also practical tools for entrepreneurs. Connecting narrative content to startup performance across different contexts, the results will deepen our understanding of when and how storytelling drives startup success, benefitting both scholarly debates about entrepreneurial narratives and venture founders and investors in practice.
3. Methodology
3.1 Research Design
This study is conducted using quantitative observational research design with web scrape data obtained from online pitch platforms such as Kickstarter. AngelList was the initial choice, but its scraping proved to be difficult due to its closed-access feature regarding investments (Kuppuswamy & Bayus, 2018), and thus, I did not include it in the final plan. So, this study deals with relatively open platforms like the Kickstarter platform, where open campaign data are available, where metrics are clearly visible and where video and text pitch materials are available.
A quantitative observational design allows analysis of naturally occurring pitch content without researcher interference, capturing how storytelling unfolds in real-world contexts. While this approach strengthens validity, it does bring potential selection bias which is addressed through sampling across diverse categories and funding outcomes.
3.2 Data Collection
3.2.1 Sampling Strategy
This will require sampling a range of startup pitches and I aim to collect between 500 to 700 (although this tradeoff is around depth and feasibility). A larger sample adds statistical power to regression analysis and lends to more subgroup analysis (e.g., pitch medium). While this amount is still small enough that semi-automated coding and quality auditing remains feasible. Finally, platforms such as Kickstarter have a large enough public archive of pitch materials to use this sampling strategy. Pitches will be selected based on availability of full text descriptions, public funding results, and campaign recency (launched in the past 10 years). The sample will include a mix of successfully and unsuccessfully funded pitches across categories to ensure variance.
3.2.2 Web Scraping Process
The researcher will collect the pitch data by using a combination of automated scraping tools and manual validation. Frameworks for scraping based on Python, like Scrapy or BeautifulSoup, would be suitable for Kickstarter and Seedrs, as they provide structured HTML content. These tools can then be configured to retrieve pitch titles, text content, video links, amounts of funding, and backer numbers. For video pitches, audio to text conversion using automatic transcription tools such as Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text. Scripts and scraping processes of data will all be within the regulations of platform terms and service as well as data ethics protocols. All scraped data will be manually checked in a 10% random sample to confirm accuracy. Duplicates and broken entries will be removed prior to analysis. 
From a software selection point of view, a custom built scraper-friendly option would be the ideal route for this thesis as control over how exactly to format data and could be customized. However, the older scraping APIs (e.g. octoparse) can be used as fallbacks in the case of technical issues.
3.3 Variable Operationalization
3.3.1 Storytelling Quality (Independent Variable)
The primary independent variable for this research is storytelling quality and it will be studied using natural language coding (NLP) programs combined with human/manual coding:
• Emotional tone: Sentiment analysis tools like VADER or TextBlob will be used to measure this variable and return polarity score based on the positive and negative use of words. Emotional tones may elicit more emotional attachment with the audience, and research (Shane et al., 2020) indicates that passion drives more investor involvement. Sentiment polarity scores will be computed using VADER. Scores > 0.3 will be considered ‘positive tone’, < -0.3 as ‘negative’, and values in between as ‘neutral’. Pitches with contradictory sentiment (e.g., enthusiastic tone + negative words) will be flagged for manual review.
• Metaphor Use: The use of metaphoric or vivid language will be examined using metaphor dictionaries and keyword pattern-searches. In the world of startups, metaphors matter to simplify the complexities of some concepts (Clarke et al., 2019). This will give a score for each pitch per frequency.
• Narrative coherence: Using a checklist to code whether the pitch has a clear beginning (problem), middle (solution), and end (future goals). Coherent stories move easier and thus they will increase credibility and understanding (Werven et al., 2019).
• Founder centricity: Pitches will be coded based on the amount of content against which the content focuses on the founders’ history, motivation, or personal stories. As It gives trust and credibility (Roundy, 2014). This will have a ratio of founder focused vs product focused content. Founder-centricity will be coded as the proportion of sentences focused on the founder’s background, motivation, or personal story versus product description. For example, ‘I left my job to solve this problem’ would count as founder-focused, while ‘Our app uses AI to optimize returns’ would count as product-focused.
• Authenticity: Following the work of Parhankangas & Ehrlich (2014), authenticity will be scored on a 3-point scale, considering indicators such as vulnerability, realism, and self-reflection in the pitch. The  3-point scale will look like this: (1) low = overly polished, vague, or exaggerated; (2) moderate = clear, but generic or safe; (3) high = includes realistic challenges, self-disclosure, or emotional honesty. Authenticity will be operationalized through a composite score based on (1) use of first-person language (e.g., “I,” “my journey”), (2) presence of emotionally vulnerable or reflective keywords (e.g., “struggled,” “learned”), and (3) linguistic simplicity as indicated by Flesch-Kincaid readability score. These elements reflect key features of authentic storytelling without relying on subjective judgment. Scores across these three indicators will be summed to create a 0–3 authenticity index for each pitch.
3.3.2 Startup Success 
Success will be measured on three metrics:
• Percentage of funding goal completed: This is the main success metric being studied here. It corrects for differences in target size, and indicates relative success. For instance, a startup raising €10,000 from a €5,000 goal (200%) has a higher momentum than a startup raising €50,000 from a €500,000 goal (10%). This metric is preferred in prior studies (Manning & Bejarano, 2016) because it reflects performance rate adjusted for expectations.
• Funding amount raised: The actual measure of total capital raised. That gives a second benchmark, but it may be skewed by aspirational or ambivalent targets.
• No. of backers/investors: This reflects the amount of trust and interest the pitch created with the users of the platform.
3.3.3 Moderating Variables
• Pitch Medium: Text-only, video-only, or hybrid. Coding will depend on the kind of embedded media on the platforms. This intermediate narrative effectiveness, owing to different channels of communication (Pera & Viglia 2016),
• Company Stage: The company stage will be classified as early-stage or later-stage. The data based on textual descriptions or labelled rounds will be used to infer this information. Building the traction of early-stage companies is minimal (Lu et al., 2022) but unlike later-stage companies, companies must rely mostly on narrative persuasion.
• Industry Sector: This Industry sector will be coded depending on tags or description of the startup from Fintech, Greentech, Edtech, etc. Why does this matter? Narrative needs and investor expectations are different in these categories (O’Connor, 2002).
3.3.4 Shark Tank Dataset (Comparative Case Analysis)
Although this research focuses mainly on crowdfunding platforms, coding Shark Tank pitches could potentially provide a useful triangulation. Shark Tank contains real investor responses, pitch results, emotions, and non-verbal signals. Prior work by Pollack et al. (2012), Turner (2023) showed that televised pitches offer an opportunity to investigate the use of impression management and persuasion tactics in high-stakes situations. If time and budget permits, a subset of the Shark Tank pitches could be manually coded with the same variables to verify the findings in a different format. The addition of this secondary data provides a comparison in order to control for the influence of narrative on pitch style consistent with Hypothesis 3 (pitch medium).
The pitches that are chosen would be transcribed from Shark Tank using a tool like Whisper, which converts speech to text. I will be working with a purposive sample of approximately 30 to 50 pitches, selected for diversity of industry, founder background, and funding outcome. I will then use the same storytelling framework used as the main analysis using Emotional Tone, Coherence, Founder-Centricity, Use of Metaphor, and Authenticity controlling for the video visual and vocal elements available. For instance, emotional tone may not be just in word choice but in how the story is delivered: founder’s facial expressions, voice modulation, and cadence all serve in determining the shape of the narrative. In that respect, this video-based sample should provide a better view for storytelling techniques that aren’t easily discerned in written pitches.
As opposed to attempting to directly compare or regress this data against the Kickstarter data, or attempting any statistical modeling at all, I’ll take the Shark Tank pitches as a qualitative validation test to check to what extent similar patterns emerge (e.g. emotional or founder-centric storytelling predicts positive investor reaction) to increase the evidence that certain narrative techniques are effective across formats. If different trends do pop up, that’s valuable as well: It may indicate that storytelling needs to change depending on who’s listening to it, or the medium by which it is conveyed.
Of course this part of the study has limitations. The number of pitches is reduced, and because Shark Tank is edited for television, some of the story or dynamics of the pitch may be lost. Still, the stakes in Shark Tank are real: founders are making pitches to investors who are investing real money. That realism, and the performative aspect of the setting makes for a useful counterpoint to the more scripted and polished world of online crowdfunding.
Ultimately, adding Shark Tank allows me to test the extent to which what we think we know about storytelling holds in another venue. It also makes the thesis more balanced, because it allows for different storytelling situations. And not just text, but voice, body language, live interaction.
